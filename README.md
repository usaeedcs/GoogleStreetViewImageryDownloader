# Mapping Environmental Indices from Street View Imagery: An Advanced Deep Learning Approach

This Python script automates the generation of nodes along linear road network paths from a given shapefile. It includes functions to calculate distances, create nodes at specified intervals, create a dataframe of latitude and longitude coordinates, and save the resulting data to CSV and Shapefile formats. The program utilizes geospatial libraries such as geopandas and pyproj to handle geographic data and projections.

This project is part of a major initiative with the primary goal of using deep learning approaches to help in mapping the environment/quality of living in an area using street view imagery. The data generated by this endeavor hold significant value for development agencies and local authorities. We aim to identify specific locations that may be deficient in crucial aspects such as infrastructure, transportation, as well as rural and urban development. This data-driven approach not only contributes to informed decision-making but also serves as a powerful tool for fostering sustainable and targeted development strategies within the community.

The use of deep learning, including recurrent neural networks, allows for capturing the geographic context of images and outperforms several baseline methods in real-world streetview imagery evaluations.
